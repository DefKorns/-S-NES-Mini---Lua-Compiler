# (S)NES Mini - Lua Compiler
Based on the work from [frostyfire03530](https://github.com/frostyfire03530).

### **What is it?**
This script allows you to decompile SNES Mini lua files.
This app is a GUI for my previous [script](https://github.com/DefKorns/classic-mini-lua-decompiler). The goal is to decrypt/encrypt (S)NES/Famicom's lua files for theme creation.

### **How to use it**
- Select your desired system
- Choose `Decode`
- Edit all the files you needed (`app location/decoded` folder) with your desired lua/text editor
- choose `Encode`
- copy the re-encrypted files to your theme

Enjoy
